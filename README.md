# vim-ariake-dark

This is a port of the beautiful [Ariake Dark](https://atom.io/themes/ariake-dark-syntax) theme from Atom to Vim. To install, it's easiest to use something like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug 'davidcelis/vim-ariake-dark'

call plug#end()

syntax on
colorscheme Ariake-Dark
set background=dark
```
